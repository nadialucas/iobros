## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:





```{r clean data, echo = FALSE}
library("kdensity")
cleaned_stamps <-
  read_csv("ps3_julia.csv")
lot_level = cleaned_stamps %>%
  group_by(house, lot, date) %>%
  summarise(target_price = mean(target_price), max_bid = mean(max_bid), avg_est = mean(avg_est), ring_won = mean(ring_won), ones = 1, ringers = mean(ringers))

library("fastDummies")
library(tidyverse)
with_dummies <- cleaned_stamps %>% fastDummies::dummy_cols(select_columns = "bidder")  %>%
  fastDummies::dummy_cols(select_columns = "us") %>%
  fastDummies::dummy_cols(select_columns = "no_value") %>%
  mutate(lnb = log(ko_bid))


# do we want to do this with lots too? I'm unsure how to translate the non-ring distribution out to the kernel

```
# What is going on with the target dummy here - the only thing not implemented
```{r regression}
fit1 <- lm(lnb ~ est_min + est_max + catalog_price + grade_min + grade_max + us_0 + us_1 + no_value_0 + no_value_1 + bidder_1 + bidder_2 + bidder_3 +
             bidder_4 + bidder_5 + bidder_6 + bidder_7 + bidder_8 + bidder_9 + bidder_10 + bidder_11, data = with_dummies)
summary(fit1)
```
```{r get b hat}
bhat = predict(fit1, newdata = with_dummies)
```

```{r density time}
# OK now I'm just unsure whether we want to be using bhat or something else as a density
h_bar = kdensity(exp(bhat), start = "gumbel", kernel = "gaussian")
#h_bar = kdensity(lot_level$target_price, start = "gumbel", kernel = "gaussian")


# Silverman's rule of thumb
library(sROC)
bwidth_silverman = bw.nrd0(lot_level$max_bid)
G_m = kCDF(lot_level$max_bid, bw= bwidth_silverman, kernel = c("normal", "epanechnikov"))
print(h_bar(100))
print(G_m(2000))
# I've confused myself with this empirical cdf stuff now so im going to bed
# but it's either this kCDF thing or ecdf thing and i dont know enough math to figure it out rn

A = integrate(function(x) h_bar(x)/(1-G_m(x)), lower = -Inf, upper = Inf)$value
print(lol)
